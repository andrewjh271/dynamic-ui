# Dynamic UI Examples

Created as part of the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-dynamic-user-interface-interactions). This project imports a dropdown menu npm package I made in a previous [project](https://github.com/andrewjh271/dropdown-menu) and implements the standard functionality of an image slider.
