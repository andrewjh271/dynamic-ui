          It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
          division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
          the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
          weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
          of either's moiety. His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
          so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
          brazed to it. I cannot conceive you. His breeding, sir, hath been at

        <p>
          But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
          elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
          though this knave came something saucily into the
          world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
          fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
          whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
          noble gentleman, Edmund?

        <p>
          Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
          Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
          In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
          To shake all cares and business from our age;
          Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
          Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
          And you, our no less loving son of Albany...

          Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
          Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
          No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
          As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
          A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
          Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

          Although the last, not least; to whose young love
          The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
          Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
